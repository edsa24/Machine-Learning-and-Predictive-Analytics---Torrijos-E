## About This Folder
This folder has the work I did in **Week 2 and Week 3**. The main goal here was to **check and merge the raw datasets** before using them to build the Milestone 1 predictive model.

I started with **3 raw CSV files**:
1. Customers  
2. Products  
3. Transactions  

I merged them together to see all the data in one place and check for missing values or errors.

## What I Did
1. **Checked each dataset**  
   - Looked for missing values, duplicates, and wrong data types  
   - Cleaned obvious errors (like text in numeric columns)  

2. **Merged the datasets**  
   - Combined customer, product, and transaction info into one dataset for easier checking  
   - Made sure all columns lined up correctly  

3. **Created a cleaned merged dataset**  
   - This is basically for checking and reference  
   - The final dataset used for Milestone 1 is `Week 3 - Homework.csv`
